@defgroup f4_text Font and Text Services

Text rendering services.

Requires: render, IO

The text package introduces the .4FNT file type, which is a simple format for
storing texture fonts. It includes a header describing the contained glyphs and
their position on the texture, followed by the texture itself stored in .PNG
format. The @c StdIO package includes a ReaderWriter for the format, see the
demo @c F4/Samples/fontfactory.lua for an example of it's use.
