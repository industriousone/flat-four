BUILDING AND INSTALLING

This is the "quick and dirty" install guide. For more detailed
instructions, see the HTML documentation, which is located in 
the F4/Docs directory. You may download the HTML documentation 
as a separate package, or autogenerate it by running Doxygen 
(http://www.doxygen.org/) in F4/Base/Docs. 

                           ---

The current build of the F4 Engine requires SDL, which can be
found at http://www.libsdl.org/. You must build or download the
DLL version of SDL, and it should be in an accessible directory
(either on the system search path or in the F4/Bin directory).
You will also need the SDL development libraries (F4 needs the
headers to build, but doesn't use the libraries otherwise).

                           ---

WIN32/MSVC++ INSTRUCTIONS

Open F4/Build/F4.dsw and build.

                           ---

GNU C++ INSTRUCTIONS

'cd F4/Build; make'

The make scripts are not yet complete. In particular there is no
dependency checking so if you start editing the header files the
changes may not get picked up. The scripts also assume that SDL
headers and libraries will be located in the system directories
(/usr/include, /usr/lib), which is where the RPM installs will
place them. 

                           ---

TESTING THE BUILD

Win32: cd F4\Samples
       ..\Bin\f4 boxes.lua

Linux: cd F4/Bin
       ../Bin/f4 boxes.lua
